# Octoprint plugin

This plugin allows you to monitor and execute some actions on your 3D print servers.

# Plugin configuration 

After installing the plugin, you just need to activate it. There is no special configuration to do

# Equipment configuration 

The configuration of Octoprint equipment is accessible from the plugins menu then Monitoring. You will find here :

-   a button to manually create an equipment
-   a button to display the configuration of the plugin
-   a button that gives you an overview of all your equipment
-   finally below you find the list of your equipment

By clicking on one of your equipment you arrive on the configuration page of your equipment including 2 tabs, equipment and controls.

-   **Equipment tab** :
    -   **Name of equipment** : name of your equipment
    -   **Activate** : makes your equipment active
    -   **Visible** : makes it visible on the dashboard
    -   **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs
    -   **Server Ip** : the server ip in question
    -   **Apikey** : global api or user key defined in Octoprint itself
-   **Orders Tab** :
    -   There are many commands. Not all are displayed by default. You can rename them, display them or not rearrange them.

You can also assign a widget of your choice. Everything is standard. Regarding the actions I will not add more than that already put.
It is out of the question for me that a badly done scenario starts to heat your printer at 4 am at 250 Â° C.
